Purple 2048 turns a classic single-player puzzle into an on-chain experience on the Base network!
Players can compete globally and store their game scores directly on-chain, ensuring transparency, fairness, and immutability. it bridges casual gaming with blockchain ownership — users don’t just play, they prove their achievements. the project also makes it easier for developers to understand how to integrate Ethers.js with Farcaster MiniApps and Base App wallets, lowering the entry barrier for Web3 game builders you can just check the project Github.

Challenges I ran into
one of the biggest hurdles was wallet compatibility across different environments like Base App, Farcaster MiniApp Frame, MetaMask & Rabby and also WalletConnect.
each has its own quirks. farcaster wallets for instance required a manual gas limit to complete transactions successfully. i also had to fix issues with auto network switching to Base, leaderboard data not updating properly, and ensuring smooth mobile behavior. debugging these without breaking the 2048 game logic was a real balancing act but we did it.
